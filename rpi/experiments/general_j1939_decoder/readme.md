# Goals of this experiment

We want to have an interface that mimics the `.dbc` functionality of normal CAN bus work. However, these files are intimidating and hard to work with for inexperienced people.

The goal of this experiment is to make a way to read and decode j1939 messages from a `.csv`.  
Why `.csv`? 
- Easy to work with
  - No problem openinng and editing in google sheets or an equivalent. 
  - Familiar to most.  
  - Can be centralised on google drive for tracking of changes. (Cannot expect people who don't know what github is.. to even work with git and commit changes)
